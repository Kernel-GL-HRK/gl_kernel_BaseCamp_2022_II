# Simple c program with commits
The main idea of of this task is to demonstrate your ability to work with git and create correctly formed commit.
So, you have to focus on the rules and principals of working with github, not on code complexity.
## Task
1. Please, write simple game "guess a number". User input some number from 0 to 9. Computer also generates random number from 0 to 9. If values are equal, user will get message “You win”. In other case – “You loose”. main() function should return 0 if you win, and non-zero value otherwise.
2. When you working on code, please divide it on several steps. Each steps will be new commit. There are possible steps:
	a. Create simple *.c file with empty main() function
	b. Write main functionality
	c. Rewrite code, that random number generates in you own defined function.
3. Check coding style with checkpatch.pl
4. Also don't forget to create .gitignore file
5. Create pull request to this repo into you own branch (have to be already exist)
6. Good luck
