GlobalLogic BaseCamp final project

1. mpu6050 gyroscope
1.1 The project uses the GY-521 gyroscope module.
    Output AD0 - connected to a power source, in this configuration the gyroscope
    has an i2c address of 0x69.
    (Some GY-521 module with a RED power LED have a DEVICE ID of 0x98).
1.2 File gl_mpu6050-overlay.dts - modified with address 0x69 and driver name
    gl_mpu6050.
    For compile gl_mpu6050.dts to .dtbo - use make dtb.
    For correct operation, the file gl_mpu6050-overlay.dtbo must be located in
    the raspberry /boot/overlays.
    To enable the overlay in the system, add dtoverlay=gl_mpu6050 to config.txt.
1.3 Implemented sysfs, read only.
    Raw accelerometer data is stored in the /sys/devices/mpu6050/accel/accel_x,
    .../accel_y or .../accel_z.
    Raw gyroscope data is stored in the /sys/devices/mpu6050/gyro/gyro_x,
    .../gyro_y or .../gyro_z.
    Temperature data is stored in the /sys/devices/mpu6050/temp - in degrees
    Celsius.
